# Cursor Rule: architecture

## Boundaries
- UI (components) ↔ State (hooks) ↔ Services (api, data) ↔ Infra
- No cross-layer imports skipping boundaries.

## State
- Local-first; lift only when shared.
- Avoid global mutable singletons.

## Data
- DTOs at boundaries, map to domain models inside.
- All IO behind interfaces (e.g., `services/`).

## Security
- No secrets in code; use env loading.
- Validate all external inputs.
